--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Suppose that we have a set of activities to schedule amongst a large number of lecture halls.
We wish to schedule all the activities using as few lecture halls as possible. Give an efficient
greedy algorithm to determine which activity should use which lecture hall and implement
this algorithm.
