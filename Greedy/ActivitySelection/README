Problem Statement
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This concerns the first activity selection problem discussed in the class with the objective
function to select maximal set of mutually compatible activities out of a given set of activities
with a defined start time and finish times. Suppose that instead of selecting the first activity
to finish, we instead select the last activity to start that is compatible to all the previous
activities. Write a program that implements this algorithm.
