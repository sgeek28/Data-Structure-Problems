Problem Statement
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Suppose the job of a firm is to manage the construction of billboards on the Jammu-Srinagar
Highway runs South-North for M kms. The possible sites for the billboards are given by
numbers x 1 , x 2 , x 3 , x 4 , x 5 ,. x n each in the interval [0M ]. x i â€™s are indicating the position of
the billboards along the Highway in kms, measured from its western end. If it is decided to
place a billboard at location x i , then the firm receives a revenue of r i > 0. Regulations of the
JK Govt require that no two of the billboards be within less than or equal to 5 kms of each
other. Thus, as part of the optimization problem, the firm has to decide where to place the
billboards at a subset of the sites x 1 , x 2 , x 3 , x 4 , x 5 ,. x n so as to maximize the total revenue,
subject to this constraint. Give an algorithm that takes in an instance of this problem as
input and returns the maximum total revenue that can be obtained from any valid subset of
sites. Give its running time also. Implement the algorithm that you designed and analyze its
time complexity.
An example : Suppose M = 20, n = 4 , [x 1 , x 2 , x 3 , x 4 ] = [6, 7, 12, 14] , [r 1 , r 2 , r 3 , r4] =
[5, 6, 5, 1]. Then, what would be the optimal solution ?


In the above implemented code greedy approach is tried,which may not be optimal solution in few test cases.
